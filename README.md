# Server Updater
With this simple JAR, you can easily update your Minecraft server every restart. Just run this JAR file in the place of your Minecraft server. Setup some configurations and you should be good to go.

# IMPORTANT
We are still in beta, which means this is by no means "complete", so if you want to use it you still have to wait.
This is a replacement of Songoda's ServerJars updater. The only difference is that this directly contacts the software's API instead of the ServerJars API.
